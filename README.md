Instruction for bin::

run bin/setup for build

run bin/parking_lot for execution without input file

run bin/parking_lot src/main/resources/parking_lot_file_inputs.txt for execution with input file,
file path can be given by you also.
For Simplicity I have included it in resource so that you change and validate it over there


run bin/combine_file for both build and execution
