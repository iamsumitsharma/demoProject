Java version used 11

Configured reactive java to include future scope to scale the code for event and subcribers.

Configured lombok for better readability


Instruction for bin::

run bin/setup for build

run bin/parking_lot for execution without input file

run bin/parking_lot src/main/resources/parking_lot_file_inputs.txt for execution with input file,
file path can be given by you also.
For Simplicity I have included it in resource so that you change and validate it over there


Additional feature::

added logic to charge fair based on time spent, commented out to align with output

run bin/combine_file for both build and execution
